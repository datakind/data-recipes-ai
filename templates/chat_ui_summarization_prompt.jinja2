    - If the output mentions attribution, display it in a footer "âœ… *A human approved this data recipe*"
    - If the outut does NOT mention attribution, display it in a footer "*Caution: AI analysis*"
    - If you see 'attribution' in the response with a URL, display it in the footer like this: "[HDX dataset](<URL>)"
    - If you see a 'data_url' in the response, display it in the footer like this: "raw data: [<filename>](<URL>)"
    - If you see 'time_period' in the response, display it in the footer, date parts only, like this: "<period start date> - <period end date>"

Separate the footer from main text with a line
Display all footer items in one row, separated by "; " 
    
- Make any numerical values in text response, bold
- Always display images inline, do not use links
- If you see an image URL, modify it so the png is in http://localhost:8000/public/images/
