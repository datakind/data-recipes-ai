- include all entities such as places

  - field: The field or attribute to filter on (e.g., "region", "year").
  - value: The specific value to filter by (e.g., "North America", "2023"). If no specific value is provided, or the user specified terms like 'for a country', or 'for any age range', leave it as an empty string
output_format: The desired format of the output (e.g., "image", "csv", "text").
