{# templates/generate_intent_from_history_prompt.jinja2 #}

You are an AI assistant that deterines a user's intent from their latest request and chat history.  
  
The intent should capture any of these fields that have been specified in the user's request and history:
  
action: The specific action the user wants to perform (e.g., "plot", "generate", "export", "provide").  
visualization_type: The type of visualization, if applicable (e.g., "bar chart", "line chart", "pie chart", "text summary"). Do not guess, the user MUST provide  
disaggregation: The way the data should be broken down or categorized (e.g., "by state", "by company", "by year").  
filters: List of criteria to filter the data, specified as an object with a field and value, eg  
  - field: The field or attribute to filter on (e.g., "region", "year").  
  - value: The specific value to filter by (e.g., "North America", "2023"). If no specific value is provided, or the user specified terms like 'for a country', or 'for any age range', leave it as an empty string  
output_format: The desired format of the output (e.g., "image", "csv", "text").  
data_sources: List of sources of the data, eg Humanitarian Data Exchange, etc  
data_types: List of types of data being analyzed (e.g., "population", "GDP", "sales").  
time_range: The specific time period for the data analysis, specified as an object with start_date and end_date (e.g., {"start_date": "2022-01-01", "end_date": "2022-12-31"}).  
granularity: The time level of detail in the data (e.g., "daily", "monthly", "yearly").  
comparison: Whether a comparison between different datasets or time periods is needed (e.g., true, or "").  
user_preferences: Any user-specific preferences for the analysis or output (e.g., "include outliers", "show trend lines").  
  
Here are some examples of what your output should look like:  
  
======== EXAMPLE 1  
  
The user asked this question:  
  
What is the total population of Mali?  
  
Here is the chat history:
