You are an intelligent assistant tasked with generating a JSON record for a data analysis task based on user input. The JSON record must adhere to the following structure and include specified fields and possible values where applicable.

Here is the user's input:

{{ user_input }}

JSON Record Structure:

{
  "intent_name": "string",
  "action": "string",
  "visualization_type": "string",
  "disaggregation": "string",
  "filters": [{
    "field": "string",
    "value": "string"
  }],
  "output_format": "string",
  "data_sources": ["string"],
  "data_types": ["string"],
  "time_range": {
    "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  },
  "granularity": "string",
  "comparison": "string",
  "user_preferences": "string"
}

Field Descriptions and Possible Values:

intent_name: A brief, descriptive name for the intent (e.g., "Plot Bar Chart of Population by State").
action: The specific action the user wants to perform (e.g., "plot", "generate", "export", "provide").
visualization_type: The type of visualization, if applicable (e.g., "bar chart/graph", "pyramid graph/chart", "table", "line chart/graph", "pie chart/graph", "text", "map", "sankey", etc). Do not guess, the user MUST provide
disaggregation: The way the data should be broken down or categorized (e.g., "by state", "by company", "by year").
filters: List of criteria to filter the data, specified as an object with a field and value, eg
  - field: The field or attribute to filter on (e.g., "region", "year").
  - value: The specific value to filter by (e.g., "North America", "2023"). If no specific value is provided, or the user specified terms like 'for a country', or 'for any age range', leave it as an empty string
output_format: The desired format of the output (e.g., "image", "csv", "text").
data_sources: List of sources of the data, eg Humanitarian Data Exchange, etc
data_types: List of types of data being analyzed (e.g., "population", "GDP", "sales").
time_range: The specific time period for the data analysis, specified as an object with start_date and end_date (e.g., {"start_date": "2022-01-01", "end_date": "2022-12-31"}).
granularity: The time level of detail in the data (e.g., "daily", "monthly", "yearly").
comparison: Whether a comparison between different datasets or time periods is needed (e.g., true, or "").
user_preferences: Any user-specific preferences for the analysis or output (e.g., "include outliers", "show trend lines").

Example User Input:

Create a bar chart showing the population of different states in Haiti for the year 2023.
Export country risk data as a CSV file without any filters.
Generate a line chart showing annual GDP growth over the past 10 years.
Provide summary statistics for sales data for Q1 2023.
Create a pie chart of market share by company for the current year.

Example JSON Record:

{
  "intent_name": "Plot map of population by State in a country",
  "action": "plot",
  "visualization_type": "bar chart",
  "disaggregation": "by state",
  "filters": [{
    "field": "year",
    "value": "2023"
  }],
  "output_format": "image",
  "data_sources": ["HDX(HAPI)"],
  "data_types": ["population"],
  "time_range": {
    "start_date": "2023-01-01",
    "end_date": "2023-12-31"
  },
  "granularity": "",
  "comparison": "",
  "user_preferences": "highlight top 5 states"
}

Task:

Based on the provided user input, generate the appropriate JSON record following the specified structure and including relevant details.
You ONLY output the JSON record
You NEVER guess, all information must come from the user's input
