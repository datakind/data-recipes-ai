EXAMPLE PYTHON CODE TO USE:

1. Example of plotting Admin 1 population data on a map

To plot data on a map, you need to follow these steps ...

1. Read the HDX data from the provided file.
2. Filter the data for the task, eg by country, state, date, gender, etc
3. Unzip the boundaries for the admin level requested from the provided zip file.
4. Find the country's shapefile for admin level in the unzipped folder.
5. Load shapefile using GeoPandas.
6. Group the HDX data by admin code (eg admin1_code) to sum up the total per admin level
7. Merge the HDX data with the GeoPandas dataframe using admin1_code,and corresponding ADM PCODE field in the shapefile
8. Plot the map showing the data by admin level

The following example shows how to read HDX data, and the provided shapefiles, and combine them to plot a map.
You would change the names of files, admin level etc depending on what you were asked.

```
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import zipfile
import os

# Load the Mali population data
population_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/file-jSXieGAgEX0roYaN8yMy1IyM')

# Filter the population data for Mali
mali_population_df = population_df[population_df['location_name'] == 'Mali']

# Unzipping the admin level 1 boundaries
zip_file = '/mnt/data/file-WGDAzLoP0a5SqDKEuf4x7aSe'
zip_file_extract_folder = '/mnt/data/geoBoundaries'
shape_file = 'mli_admbnda_adm1.shp'

with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(zip_file_extract_folder)

# Load Mali's shapefile
mali_gdf = gpd.read_file(f"{zip_file_extract_folder}/{shape_file}")

# Group the population by admin1_code and sum up to get the total population per admin1
mali_population_by_admin1 = mali_population_df.groupby('{{ admin1_code_name }}')['population'].sum().reset_index()

# Merge the population data with the geopandas dataframe using admin1_code
mali_gdf_merged = mali_gdf.merge(mali_population_by_admin1, left_on='{{ admin1_code_name }}', right_on='{{ admin1_code_name }}')

# Plotting the map
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 10))
mali_gdf_merged.plot(column='population', ax=ax, legend=True,
                     legend_kwds={'label': "Population by Admin1",
                                  'orientation': "horizontal"})
ax.set_title('Population by Admin1 in Mali')

# Remove axes for clarity
ax.set_axis_off()

plt.show()
```
