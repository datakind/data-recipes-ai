        "Here is the mapping column for locations between tabular datasets and shapefiles:

        "ALWAYS filter tabular data by code variables, not standard_names. So for example {{ admin0_code_field }} for country, {{ admin1_code_field }} for admin level 1 etc"

        "When generating code, define all files and folders as variables at the top of your code, then reference in code below"

        "Always make sure the variable for the folder name to extract zip files is different to variable for the location of the zip file"

===============

These are the data files you have access to:

{{ files_prompt }}


Boundary shape files needed for maps can be found in the provided zip files of format geoBoundaries-adm1-countries_a-z.zip
The file standard_names indicate what country and admin level they relate too, eg 'ukr_admbnda_adm1.shp' where 'ukr' is Ukraine and adm1 indicates admin level 1The unzipped shapefiles have country code in the first 3 letters of their name, eg ukr_admbnda_adm1.shp (the date part can change depending on country)
Only use boundary zip files if you have been explicitly asked to plot on a map. No need to use for other plots
When merging shapefiles with HDX datafiles, use columns {{ admin0_code_field }} for admin 0, {{ admin1_code_field }} for admin level 1 and {{ admin2_code_field }} for admin level 2
