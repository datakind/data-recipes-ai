Using the database tables list below, and the columns provided in each table, generate 
Python that does the following

{{ recipe_intent }}

Coding tips ...

The shapefile in the database will need to be converted to a geoseries for plotting, here is an example:

```
# Convert the data into a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=["adm1_code", "population", "geometry"])

# Convert the 'geometry' column into a GeoSeries
df['geometry'] = df['geometry'].apply(lambda x: wkb.loads(x, hex=True))

# Convert the DataFrame into a GeoDataFrame
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry='geometry')
```
Also, please always save any images to a .png file.

Always specify a clear title on any graphs or maps. 
Always add annotations, labels and units on any graphs/maps
You can use any kind of visualization

IMPORTANT: Generate reusable code, by putting it in a function with arguments, and provide an example of how to call it.

Always print any SQL statements and the size of the results returned

Database connection details are in the following environment variables (saved in the .env file) ...

POSTGRES_DATA_HOST
POSTGRES_DATA_PORT
POSTGRES_DATA_DB
POSTGRES_DATA_USER
POSTGRES_DATA_PASSWORD

Using python .env module to load these environment varaibles.

In SQL queries with more than one table, always use table aliases to avoid ambiguous columns

Make note of column types, if you are asked to plot the count of something, SUM will not work

Always use country codes instead of names where possible

You ONLY generate code that can be run.

You write code which adheres to best practice, well commented, formatted and structured. You must adhere to PEP 8, and the Python style guide.

You write code that is generic and can be re-used just by calling them with different parameters. 

DO NOT create functions specific to a country, organization, date range, etc. Instead make the function generic and pass in parameters.
DO NOT Hard code an entities like organizations, locations, date ranges etc inside functions. The must be passed into functions as parameters.

All logic to check results and handle errors must in in these functions

For functions you have been provided, always pass in function params dictionaries with the '**' prefix, for example `params={'a':b}\ncall function(**params)` or `call function(**{'a':b})`
For functions you write, specify and document all required parameters and output format

If the user provides an ambiguous location and it's a country, use the ISO3 code for admin level 0
You are coding in Python, comments start with '#'
You only call the functions provided for getting data
NEVER add a prefix or namespace when calling the functions you have been provided, call them directly
Be cautious with printing, avoid output of large amounts of data, but do print the ouput of calling generated code
Always print the size of the output data, for example `print("DEBUG INFO - Length of data is: ",len(data))`
Only use single quotes in code, never double quotes
Always check a dictionary or dataframe has data before accessing it by record label or index, especially when calculating a metric such as sum
Put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line.
Never plot to the screen, ALWAYS plot to a png file and return the file location as a string
Always save plot png files into the ./work folder
Object of type int64 is not JSON serializable, convert to int

Structure the code to be a set of functions, with one overall function to solve the task and a call to it. 
Never use function name 'main' or 'main_function', instead use a descriptive name for the function
Never create functions which have a name of a parameter, for example 'get_data_eduction' is not allowed, instead use 'get_data' and pass in a parameter 'education'
Never use ```, only provide fully working code
Don't write functions which perform the task done by functions you already have access to, instead call the function directly

YOU MUST Prevent code from being run when the code is imported as a module by using `if __name__ == "__main__"`

DO NOT create functions specific to a country, organization, date range, etc. Instead make the function generic and pass in parameters from the top level
DO NOT Hard code an entities like organizations, locations, date ranges etc inside functions. The must be passed into functions as parameters from the top level

Always return the answer from the main function to the code which calls it.
If the data in the answer is a dataframe, return as a csv string
If the data in the answer is a dictionary, return as a json file
If the data in the answer is a list, return as a list
If the data in the answer is a plot, return as file location to a png image file as a json record {‘file’:’<filename>’}

Never convert a JSON response to a string, leave it as JSON

Here is a pseudo-code example layout ...

```

{{ imports_content }}

def function1(<params):
    <CODE>

def function2(<params):
    <CODE>

def function3(<params>):
    function1(<params>)
    function2(<params>)
    <CODE TO CALCULATES ANSWER, HANDLING ERRORS>
    <PRINT ANSWER>
    return <ANSWER>



if __name__ == "__main__":
    <ANSWER> = function3(<params>):
```


IMPORTANT: If calling a function already available to you, do not copy the code into your function, instead call the function directly.

Tables and their columns of data available to you ...

{{ data_info }}

You should respond with a json record with a field 'code'
